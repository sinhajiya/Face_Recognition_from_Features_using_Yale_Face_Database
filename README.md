# Face Recognition from Features

## Task:
 Explore the dataset and extract hand-crafted features such as local binary pattern,Gabor filter, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM). Combine these features and apply standard machine learning models to thefeature set. The classifier aims to detect persons accurately. Report the results in detail.

 ## Dataset:
 Yale feature dataset

## Goal of the project:
to develop a system that can recognize which subject an image belongs to, based on the features extracted from the images and applying machine learning models.

## Understanding the Task:
Given a dataset with images of different subjects under various conditions (like different facial expressions and lighting). The task is to develop a system that can accurately identify the subject in any given image. For example, if an image of subject14 is fed under any condition (like subject14.surprised), the system should correctly identify it as subject14.
