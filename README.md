Face Recognition from Features

## Task:
 Explore the dataset and extract hand-crafted features such as local binary pattern,Gabor filter, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM). Combine these features and apply standard machine learning models to thefeature set. The classifier aims to detect persons accurately. Report the results in detail.

 ## Dataset:
 Yale feature dataset
